I decided to create a Next.js app for quick startup with Typescript and using Jest and SCSS.
I divided the database into 2 main categories: movies, and characters, with quotes being tied to each characters so it made more sense. 
I put all the characters in a reusable card component for easier maintainability. 

Future goals would've been:
- adding search functionality
- adding more interactive parts to display more info

Then I deployed using vercel.
